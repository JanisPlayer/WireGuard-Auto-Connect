# WireGuard-Auto-Connect
This script allows you to automatically enable or disable WireGuard based on the network your device is connected to. It checks the currently connected SSID or MAC address and makes sure WireGuard is only active when you are away from your home network. Otherwise, it will automatically disable it when you are at home.
